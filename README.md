# ABMsForFun
A repository to collect code related to some agent-based models I'm playing around with. 

I finally decided to read up on ABMs and realized I had at least half the necessary experience to start coding them: an understanding of INDIVIDUAL-based models (read: models of pigeons, rats, and mice learning and performing in operant chambers). Thus, I set out to start coding an Agent-based model incorporating iteractions between animals. The first ABM I decided to code was a social-foraging simulator. That said, I plan on experimenting with other scenarios as well. Enjoy!

1. Social Foraging Rat (SFR) ABM. Very much a work in progress.
